    "# $R_{\\alpha}$: Measuring Robustness in Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I provide an implementation of $R_{\\alpha}$ for directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is $R_{\\alpha}$\n",
    "$R_{\\alpha}$ quantifies the robustness of a graph, particularly useful to assess the stability of ecological networks, such as food webs. Formally, it reflects the relative amount of primary extinctions necessary for the network to reduce to $\\alpha %$ of its original size. Secondary extinctions occur when species are left without any inward-edge. Hence, $R_{\\alpha} \\leq \\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Analysis\n",
    "A high level overview of the steps performed by the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); padding:10px 0;font-family:monospace;\">\n",
    "while size > alpha * original size <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; primary extinction = random node <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbors = neighbors of primary extinction <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove primary extinction from graph <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while there are neighbors <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if in-degree of neighbor == 0 <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save neighbor of neighbors <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove neighbor from graph <br>\n",
    "return current graph size / original graph size <br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual implementation the algorithm is more complex. The search for secondary extinctions is performed iteratively on the k-th distance-level-neighbors of the primary extinction, until all the necessary removals are performed. More details in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, the input graph is a complete directed graph, such that the running time of the algorithm is in $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the amount of nodes in the graph. The algorithm performs fairly well on graphs with lower connectance, because the search for secondary extinctions takes far less time in these graphs. The amount of k-level-neighbors to check after each removal is of $|K|^2$ in the worst case. Thanks to a \"change flag\" when iterating through the neighbors, if no new neighbor was removed, the loop breaks, and the next random removal can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Basal nodes can be removed, but are never part of a secondary extinction, because they're not successors of any specie.\n",
    "- No rewiring of connections is performed.\n",
    "- It is possible that the graph disconnets. This happens if a cycle gets isolated from the rest of the network. We assume isoltated cycle, which no longer receive energy from any basal nodes to be valid, and to not die out.\n",
    "- Isolated self-loops are removed if created by removal. If the original graph already contains isolated self-loops, the algorithm will just not care about them.\n",
    "\n",

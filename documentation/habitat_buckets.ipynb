    "# Bucket-Probability-Distribution for Threatened Habitats Attack Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "The problem consists in assigning probabilities to different buckets to pick a node from for removal.\n",
    "We want the removal-probability of a node to be proportional to \"how much\" this node is present in the threatened habitat.\n",
    "We will then create the needed buckets and fill them with the corresponding nodes. \n",
    "In the robustness analysis, we then pick a bucket according to the computed (discrete-) probability distribution, and randomly remove a node from within the bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mock Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique Habitats: \n",
    "- Grassland\n",
    "- Cropland; Grassland\n",
    "- Forest; Grassland\n",
    "- Forest; Shrubland; Urban\n",
    "- Shrubland; Urban\n",
    "- Food-group\n",
    "\n",
    "Threatened Habitat: \n",
    "- Grassland.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation of Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, for each node we compute the proportion of the threatened habitat (Grassland) to the number of habitats, in which a node is present.\n",
    "We will build the buckets based on the unique combinations of threatened habitat over number of habitats. \n",
    "As we do not remove nodes which are part of the habitat food-groups, we simply do not consider them for now.\n",
    "Later on we will assign these nodes a removal probability of zero.\n",
    "Proportions $a_i$, where $i=1...n$:\n",
    "- $a_1 = 1/1 = 100\\%$: (Grassland)\n",
    "- $a_2 = 1/2 = 50\\%$: (Cropland; Grassland) and (Forest; Grassland)\n",
    "- $a_3 = 0/3 = 0\\%$: (Forest; Shrubland; Urban)\n",
    "- not considered for now: Food-group\n",
    "\n",
    "From these proportions we extract 4 unique buckets, which later on we fill with the corresponding nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Smallest Bucket-Removal-Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we want nodes which are not present in the threatened habitat (Grassland), to have a removal-probability $p$ greater than zero. \n",
    "Specifically we define: \n",
    "$$y = p({\\{habitats \\setminus grassland\\}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, nodes belonging to the habitats (Forest; Shrubland; Urban) and (Shrubland; Urbana) will be part of the bucket $\\{habitats \\setminus grassland\\}$, with a removal probability of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probabilites\n",
    "\n",
    "As the probabilities of removal from the different buckets must sum to 1:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i = 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The single probabilities are the equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_1 = \\frac{1 + x}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + x)} \\\\\n",
    "p_2 = \\frac{0.5 + x}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + x)} \\\\\n",
    "p_3 = \\frac{min_prop + x}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + x)} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the term that enables to have a target probability of $y$ ($p({\\{habitats \\setminus grassland\\}})$) for the bucket where the proportion of the threatened habitat is equal to zero: $a_3 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $x$ we solve the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "y = \\frac{min_prop + x}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + x)} \\\\\n",
    "min_prop + x = y \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + x) \\\\\n",
    "min_prop + x = y(nx) + y \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\\\\n",
    "min_prop(1-yn) + x(1-yn) = y \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\\\\n",
    "x = \\frac{(1-yn)}{y \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i} - min_prop(1-yn)\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we pick $y = 5\\%$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = \\frac{(1-0.05n)}{0.05 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i} - 0(1-0.05n)\n",
    "x = 0.088\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution will then look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_1 = \\frac{1 + 0.088}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + 0.088)} \\\\\n",
    "p_2 = \\frac{0.5 + 0.088}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + 0.088)} \\\\\n",
    "p_3 = \\frac{0 + 0.088}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i + 0.088)} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell we make sure that the probabilites sum up to one."
